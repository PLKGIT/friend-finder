### Using Friend Finder
  * Navigate to the home page on Heroku.
  * Click the "Take the Survey" button in the header.
  * Complete the survey form and click the Submit button.
  * After successful form validation, the system will add the user to the friends list.
  * The app tallies the difference between the user's survey answers and other friends to determine the closest match.
  * Finally, the system opens a modal containing the name and picture of the survey taker's closest match.
  Note: There are links on the Home and Survey pages that allow the user to see the complete list of friends in JSON format.
